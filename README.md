# 3BP_Remix
Modified version of Tian Feng/dB_Electronics triple bypass v2 board

Incorporstes 5.6k pull up resistors for the RGB lines, as most 3BP installs lift the VDP pins to isolate them from the Genesis/MD PCB. Based on research by Tian Feng, this causes a loss of fidelity in color transitions.

The positioning of the Mini DIN has also been adjusted to fit alongside the Model 1's existing video connector.
